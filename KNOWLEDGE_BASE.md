# Project: SLIDESHOWS

## Version: 0.8

## Current Status:
The project is focused on creating HTML-based slideshows. The primary HTML file, `index.html`, has been updated to use direct file paths for all images instead of Base64 encoded data. All Pixabay-related files have been removed.

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions:

### 1. Missing Logos and "Provided image is not valid." API Error:
*   **Problem:** Logos (`ACT.png`, `Bell.svg`) and other images were not displaying in `index.html`. Attempts to "fix" this resulted in an API error: `âœ• [API Error: [{"error": {"code": 400, "message": "Provided image is not valid.", ...}}]]`.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   `index.html` contained placeholder comments like `<!-- REPLACE WITH BASE64 ENCODED IMAGE DATA FOR ... -->` in `<img>` tags, indicating an expectation for Base64 encoded images.
    *   The `orchestrate_image_downloads.js` script explicitly stated it no longer performed Base64 encoding, suggesting a broken or removed workflow.
    *   The API error was likely triggered by an external process (possibly a Netlify feature or a manual attempt to process images) trying to handle the image files.
    *   Upon inspection, the `ACT.png` and `Bell.svg` logo image files themselves were confirmed to be faulty.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   All Base64 placeholder comments in `index.html` were replaced with direct relative paths to the image files (e.g., `src="images/ACT.png"`).
    *   The faulty logo images (`ACT.png`, `Bell.svg`) were identified as the root cause for their non-display and potential API errors during processing.
    *   All files related to Pixabay (`download_pixabay_image.py` and downloaded Pixabay images) were removed as they were no longer in use.

## Next Steps:
The user needs to replace the faulty logo images (`ACT.png`, `Bell.svg`) with valid versions.
